The execution of this program is simple. The main method is located within
the iss package with the name "mainProgram". Simply execute that class and you
will see a console based output of our project.

There are 3 packages. One package includes all the test cases. The other package
contains all the sensors and the sensor interface. The last package includes
the ISS and the main program. 

Note: We have 2 different temperature implementations because 2 people were very
interested in doing a temperature sensor. As a result we have 2 temperature
sensors but only one is being used in the ISS. However, you can use either one
interchangeably.
